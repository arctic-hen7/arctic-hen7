### Hi there 👋!

I'm arctic_hen7, a freelance Rust developer with a passion for open-source and building cool stuff!

You can see my blog and my projects on my personal site at <https://arctic-hen7.github.io>!

- 🔭 I’m currently (mainly) working on [Perseus](https://github.com/framesurge/perseus) and some new stuff from [Framesurge](https://github.com/framesurge)...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust for web development (and building the tech behind it)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting
- 💬 Ask me about Rust, command aliasing, Rust web dev, and adding unnecessary features to things for no particular reason
- 📫 How to reach me: Gitter, email, carrier pigeon
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him (the hen is male...don't worry about it)
- ⚡ Fun fact: you could fit 2.5 billion people in Cyprus at the same population density as [Dharavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharavi)
- 🗣️ Motto: *quaerendo invenietis*, which translates as *by seeking, you shall find* (from J.S. Bach's [*Musikalisches Opfer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Musical_Offering))
